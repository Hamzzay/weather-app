This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## How the App Works

### Overview

This React Native application is designed to provide weather forecasts for various cities. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver current and weekly weather updates.

### Main Components

- **Home Screen**: Displays the current weather for the user's location and a list of cities added by the user. Users can tap on a city to view detailed weather information.
  
- **Detail Weather Screen**: Provides detailed weather data for a selected city, including current temperature, weather conditions, and a 5-day forecast.

- **Add City Screen**: Allows users to search for cities and add them to their list for quick access to weather updates.

### Key Features

- **Location-Based Weather**: The app uses the device's geolocation to fetch and display weather data for the user's current location.
- **City Management**: Users can add or remove cities from their list to view weather updates for those locations.
- **Interactive UI**: The app includes Lottie animations and a user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience.

### API Integration

The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Ensure you have a valid API key configured in the codebase.

### State Management

The app uses Redux for state management, which helps in efficiently handling weather data and user interactions.
